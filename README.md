### variable "bI" is changed to "incrementButton"

### variable "bD" is changed to "decrementButton"

### variable "bR" is changed to "resetButton"

### variable "ctr" is changed to "counterDisplay"

# Duplicated Code

### the three event listeners in the code had 3 of the exact lines of code so I turned that into a function which makes it easier to read and make the code look cleaner.
